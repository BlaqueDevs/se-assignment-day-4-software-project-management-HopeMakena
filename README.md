- Customer satisfaction deadlines builds,confindence and leading to higher customer satisfation and potentially reapet business.
- Team motivation deadlines can boot team morale and create a sense of accomplishment.

- Team empowerment: empower team members to take ownership of their tasks.
- Skill development: provide the necessary training and resources for team members to perform their roles.
- Problem identification: encourage earl identification of issues and address them to prevent delays.
  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

- Improved decision making: project managers can make informed decision throughout the project.
- Increased profitability: effective cost management directly impacts profitability by maximizing profit .
- Ensuring financial stability: project can avoid overspending and ensure financial stability.


- Detaied budget: project budgets using appropriate estimation methods, all potential costs and building.
- Effective communication: establish culture that encourages proactive problem solving.
  
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Waterfall focus  completing all phases in order.
- Approach: linear, sequential.
- Planning: detaild upfront planning.
- Flexibility: limited flexibility to accomodate changes.

Agile focus delivering value incrementally and iteratively.
- Approach: iterative, flexible
- Planning: iterative planning, evolving as the project progresses.
- Flexibility: high flexibility to adapt to changes.

Advantages
   Agile
  - Reduced risk: early and frequent feedback helps identify and address potential issues early.
  - Faster delivery: shorter sprints enable quicker delivery of working software and customer values.
  - Flexibility and adaptability: allow quick adaptation to changing requirements.
Disadvantages
- Lack of prdicatability: iterative nature of Agile can make it difficult to predict project timelines and costs upfront.
- Requites skilled teams: require teams with strong self-organization, communication and collaboration skills.



Advantages
Waterfall
